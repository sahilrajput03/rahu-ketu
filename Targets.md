[Submission system](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/fullstackopen2019)	

* If you are using a private repository, add *mluukkai* as a collaborator.

* Exercises are submitted **one part at a time**. When you have once submitted exercises for a part, you can no longer submit any more exercises for that part.

* The [MOSS](https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/) system for detecting plagiarism is used to check exercises submitted to GitHub. 

* Many of the exercises build a larger application bit by bit. In these cases, submitting only the completed application is enough. You can make a commit after each exercise, but that is not compulsory.

#### Full stack project

A Full stack project worth 1-10 credits will be available through the Open University.

For the project, an application is implemented in React and/or Node. Implementing a mobile application in React Native is also possible.

The number of credits is based on hours of work done. One credit is approximately 17.5 hours of work. The work is graded pass/fail.

It is possible to complete the project as a pair or a group.

For more information, see [the open university page](https://courses.helsinki.fi/fi/aytkt21010en/130941690).

The problem is, they only host the most popular libraries.
We host all the popular libraries - JavaScript, CSS, SWF, images, etc!

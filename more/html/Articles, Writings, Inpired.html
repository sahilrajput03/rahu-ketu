<ul>
<li>The production software can perform at the necessary workload without disruption or degradation of the service</li>
<li>Software has been successfully tested in different production scenarios</li>
<li>Transforming working prototype into production software which runs on fail-safe redundant architecture that can work in real business, i.e.Â production environment, needs time, code refactoring, and attention to details</li>
<li>The production code has acceptable level of maintainability and is reasonably well commented</li>
<li>The documentation manual explains functionality, all features and facilitates maintenance</li>
<li>If the production software is an international service or application, it must be localized</li>
<li>Production code is used by end-users, often customers under conditions described in Terms-of-Service Agreement</li>
<li>Production software does not necessarily mean reliable mission critical software</li>
<li>The software does well, what it was intended to do</li>
<li>Log files provide an accurate description of run-time performance and software reliability metrics and reporting which do facilitate debugging and software maintainability</li>

Nirvana: a transcendent state in which there is neither suffering, desire, nor sense of self, and the subnject is released from the effects of karma and the cycle of death an rebirth. It represents the final goal of Buddhish. 
Nirvana has a shadik arth as 'bujha hua'. But in Boddh, Jain and Vadik Dharam, it has special meaning. Sharaman vichar dhara mein dukh or pira se mukti paane ki sithti hai.
In pali language, nirvana has meaning - mukti paana - means greedyness, gharana and bharam ki agni se mukh. This is the ultimate truth of boddh dharma and jain dharama main principle.

•WebAssembly –

The future of JS and multi-language web by Kas Perch

-Mulitiple languages are capable of performing tasks at different speeds, so some language for example like c perform image manipulation with a so called library – wasm-imagemagick in the browser upto 10x faster than JS can. So using web assembly, things would be much better using different languages for different type of task and their requirement and without rewriting entire library in some other language if there is already a better code/library is there in some other language.

-Shows the real power of not having to rewrite code and being able to let us use the right too for the job.

•Node-gyp - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39739626/what-is-node-gyp

Everybody wants to deprecate node-gyp and WebAssembly would allow us to do this.

We can run webassembly on serverless which is prettry cool.

•WebAssembly Is going to create better browser experiences.

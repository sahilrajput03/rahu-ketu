- Yoyo.!!
- The production software can perform at the necessary workload without disruption or degradation of the service
- Software has been successfully tested in different production scenarios
- Transforming working prototype into production software which runs on fail-safe redundant architecture that can work in real business, i.e. production environment, needs time, code refactoring, and attention to details
- The production code has acceptable level of maintainability and is reasonably well commented
- The documentation manual explains functionality, all features and facilitates maintenance
- If the production software is an international service or application, it must be localized
- Production code is used by end-users, often customers under conditions described in Terms-of-Service Agreement
- Production software does not necessarily mean reliable mission critical software
- The software does well, what it was intended to do
- Log files provide an accurate description of run-time performance and software reliability metrics and reporting which do facilitate debugging and software maintainability

**Electron**: GitHub (a microsoft subsidiary) - Build cross platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

- **Electron** (formerly known as **Atom Shell**[[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)#cite_note-5)) is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) [framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework) developed and maintained by [GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub).[[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)#cite_note-6) Electron allows for the development of desktop [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI) applications using web technologies: It combines the [Chromium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromium_(web_browser)) rendering engine and the [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) runtime.

- Electron is the main GUI framework behind several notable open-source projects including Atom,GitHub Desktop,Light Table,Visual Studio Code,and WordPress Desktop.

Security: Because Electron applications are [web applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application) running in the Chromium engine, they may be vulnerable to web-related attacks such as cross-site scripting attacks, through the same attack vectors as a browser (E.g. Chromium) or other internal components (Node.js) if using certain versions of Electron.[[14\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)#cite_note-cve-2018-1000136-14) Examples of such vulnerabilities have been fixed in the 1.7.13, 1.8.4, and 2.0.0-beta.5 Electron releases.[[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_(software_framework)#cite_note-Webview_Vulnerability_Fix-15)

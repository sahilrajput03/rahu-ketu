# The 6 tools that changed JavaScript for me

Instead of CSS I use [JSS](https://cssinjs.org/?v=v10.1.1), and instead of HTML + JS, I use [TSX](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsx.html), all CSS, HTML, JS in a single file in TypeScript, and I love it, everything has IntelliSense, compile errors, types, there’s no context switching. 

The even better side of it? It’s performant and keeps getting better with each new version, more JSS is transpiled to static CSS, more TSX is optimized, etc, so you can program idiomatically, and with time, the transpilers improve the output.

<p><a href="https://medium.com/@cbernardes?source=post_page-----189562fac0a7----------------------">GET or POST? 11 interview questions that most devs get wrong. @ MEDIUM.COM</a></p>
<p>_from above article:-</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><p><strong>GET responses can be cached</strong> . BUT POST can’t be cached on the client side.
POST is not Idempotent (idempotent means returning same even when queried for multiple times.)</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Get is a safe method</strong></p>
<p>Because this method should NEVER change a resource (If it does you are not implementing RESTful best practices), it is considered safe.</p>
<p><strong>Safe methods</strong> are HTTP methods that do not modify resources.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li><p>Q:Considering a Static Website, what is the only method this app responds to?</p>
<p> <strong>Static Websites only responds to GET requests</strong></p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Which method has length restrictions?</strong></p>
<p>Regarding POST, because the payload is send in the request’s body, technically, there is no limit of data to be sent <strong>(6)</strong> neither data type restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>10. Which method can be bookmarked?</strong></p>
<p>POST should not be bookmarked and the reasons are a combination of a few topics discussed above:</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Attempting to bookmark a POST will just result in a GET operation on the URL.</li>
<li>The method is not idempotent so there is not guarantee the response will always be the same. It could result in a duplicated bank transaction, for example.</li>
<li>The URL would lose its parameters as bookmark doesn’t support a body payload.</li>
<li>It may contain sensitive data, which should not be stored.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
